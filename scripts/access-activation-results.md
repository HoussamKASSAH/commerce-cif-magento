1. To retrieve a table of activation ids (first column) and action names (second column), run
```
# AIO CLI
aio runtime:activation:list

# OW CLI
wsk activation list
```

Optionally, using the `--help` parameter, you see an overview of additional parameters to further filter and expand the list.

2. To see the meta data of a specific action invocation from the given list, use
```
# AIO CLI
aio runtime:activation:get ACTIVATION-ID

# OW CLI
wsk activation get ACTIVATION-ID
```
This command will return a formatted JSON response that contains data like duration, response and others.
